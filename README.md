# Planning for e-commerce app
On home page of your e-commerce app see a full list of the items you can purchase. Click login and see your shopping cart appearing on a new tab. Click on purchasing items to add them to your shopping cart. Chek out the total price for your order and notice a button for you to make a payment. Also, add reviews on the items and look at all left reviews on that items. If you change your mind you can go back and edit your review. In case, you added an item to your shopping cart and changed your mind on purchasing hit delete to remove that item.
